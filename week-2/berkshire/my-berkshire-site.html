<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was much more fun to create an actual site using the HTML tags and context from the example and see it display a real working site.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Not bad, I found it interesting to learn about all the different posibilities for naming different parts of the website, header / footer / aside / section. I think it's a little bit confusing though, since it doesn't necessarily show up right now in our webpage with any differences. It will probably become more clear once we start using CSS style sheets.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We did well. Since there wasn't much formatting done on the basic webpage to begin with there wasn't much desire to add style in the HTML itself.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It seems good that it's such a universally used markup language that can be used to display a webpage in any browser. I think it's a bit annoying that there are so many tags that are needing for so many different parts of the website. For example, each bullet in a list needing to begin and end with the <li> tags.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I think it's useful for me to write everything that we learn how to use every time to help commit it to memory as opposed to copy and pasting.
