// As a user, I want to be able to provide a list of any amount of whole numbers and be able to call 3 calculations on them. I want accuracy on each of these functions, including decimal places.
// The first (function called "sum") should be able to add up and total the numbers in my list.
// The second (function called "mean") should be able to average the numbers in my list.
// The last (function called "median") should be able to tell me what the middle value is for the numbers in my list. If there are two items in the middle it should tell me the number between those two. (Ex: 5 and 7, middle is 6.)
