        If you open the terminal on your computer, (command-spacebar, type in "terminal"), a magical box of wonders appears!  Well, maybe it doesn't look so magical at first, but it can do amazing things.  You can think of the command line as a super charged version of your "Finder."  In your terminal, you can navigate to all the files in your computer, find out information about them, create, delete, copy, and edit files and directories (a fancy word for folder), search for text in a file, change permissions on a file, run code, and SO MUCH MORE! We focused on repeating and memorizing the basic navigational commands.  Here are a few of them you can try out.

      <ul class="blog-list">
        <li>pwd - Print working directory - This shows you the directory you are currently in.</li>
        <li>hostname - Show my computer's network name </li>
        <li>mkdir folder_name - Make a new directory </li>
        <li>rmdir folder_name - Remove a directory </li>
        <li>touch file_name - Create a file </li>
        <li>rm file_name - Remove a file </li>
        <li>ls - List everything inside a directory</li>
        <li>cd - Change to a new directory</li>
        <li>cp - Copy a file or directory</li>
        <li>Mv - Move a file or directory</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Much like this, developers who work on complex programming projects often have several programmers working on the code in many different features. Additionally, as changes are made there is always a chance that a bug can be introduced that can cause problems that need to be addressed. In order to track the changes made to the code, git provides version control on the files being created and edited to help make revision easier. Git records the user, time, and what changes are made to the code so that if needed, one can go back to a previous version of the code to review what was done or to find the source of any bugs. It also allows you to revert to previous working versions of the code.

<!--
- What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

We used header, main, and section. I frequently use the section tag, but realized in this challenge I've been using it slightly incorrectly. You're supposed to include a header for each section, which I haven't been doing. I use section a lot because it seems like the most logical way to separate out different parts of the site, without using something generic like <div>.

- How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements get laid out on the page in the order they are listed in the html document and with whatever positioning is done in the stylesheet using CSS. The browser always goes through the document from top to bottom to display elements.

- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how to create a snippet! I'm not sure how often I will use snippets in the future. Definitely for now I think the best way for me to learn is to practice writing everything out completely every time.
