- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on GitHub you'll first find the section at the top of the screen and click on the arrow next to the plus sign. Select New Repository. Click on the box under "Repository Name" and fill in a title. Click on the green button at the bottom called "Create Repository". Once you have your new repository, find the name of it on your github account under the "Repositories" section. Click on the title. At the top next to the words "HTTPS" click on the URL, highlight it, and copy it. Then, open a command line session and navigate to the place where you want to clone the repository. Once there, type "git clone <insert URL>" and you're done!.

- Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the code provided is open to the public. Anyone can see the code that is being used, as opposed to most private software which you cannot see how the programs run.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that Open Source is great, it makes much more sense why companies trying to profit off their software would not use it, but I think keeping software open source should allow for more innovation and ultimately better programs. It doesn't really make me feel particularly nervous or protective, but I also haven't created a lot of programs yet. Utopia might be a strong word, but I do think that the general concept is really great for the programming world.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are important so that the persons who want to edit or use your code have the appropriate permissions. Without using a license one wouldn't necessarily know what they are or aren't allowed to do or share when helping you with your code or if they wanted to use it for something on their own.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I was having trouble with not seeing my commits show up in the master after I had pushed it to github. I was forgetting to do the "git pull origin master" afterwards so I wasn't pulling in the changes from github onto the master branch.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
