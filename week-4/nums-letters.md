- What does puts do?
 - Puts displays some text to the console.
- What is an integer? What is a float?
 - An integer is a whole number (ex: 5, 19, -2). A float is a number that includes decimal places (ex: 1.1, 5.0, 0.9999).
- What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
 - Integer division rounds down to the nearest whole number while float division does the "actual math" needed to get the exact answer. To someone who doesn't know anything about programming I'd say float gives you the "correct" answer while integer gives you a close answer.

Hours in a year:
```
puts 365 * 24
=> 8760
```

Minutes in a decade:
```
puts 10 * 365 * 24 * 60
=> 5256000
```

- How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

 - Not entirely sure I understand what this question is asking. It performs the actions similarly to how one would expect from a calculator... + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division.

- What is the difference between integers and floats?

 - An integer is a whole number (ex: 5, 19, -2). A float is a number that includes decimal places (ex: 1.1, 5.0, 0.9999).

- What is the difference between integer and float division?

 - When doing division on an integer the result is going to be an integer, if needed Ruby will round down to the nearest whole number. Float division, however, will output decimal places to give the more "correct" answer.

- What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

 - Strings are text and can include words, symbols, and numbers. You would use strings any time you want to pass or display text.

- What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

 - Local variables are variables that are defined within the scope of an individual ruby script or within a particular block (like a loop for example)

- How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

 - This challenege was pretty good. I did get a good review of the basics in Ruby.
