=begin

define a new method called separate_commma

separate the numbers into separate elements in an array, num_array

create a new blank array, comma_num_array

set a counter to the length of the array

create a loop, while the counter is less than the length of the num_array

add the first element in num_array to comma_num_array

For each element in num_array

IF the counter is length of num_arry - 1
add the element in num_array to comma_num_array
if the
